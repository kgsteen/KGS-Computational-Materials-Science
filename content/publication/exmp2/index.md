abstract: It is well-understood that during the liquid-to-solid phase transition of alloys, elements segregate in the bulk phase with the formation of microstructures. In contrast, we show here that in a Biâ€“Ga alloy system, highly ordered nanopatterns emerge preferentially at the alloy surfaces during solidification. We observed a variety of transition, hybrid and crystal-defect-like patterns, in addition to lamellar and rod-like structures. Combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the influence of the superficial Bi and Ga2O3 layers during surface solidification and elucidated the pattern-formation mechanisms, which involve surface-catalysed heterogeneous nucleation. We further demonstrated the dynamic nature and robustness of the phenomenon under different solidification conditions and for various alloy systems. The surface patterns we observed enable high-spatial-resolution nanoscale-infrared and surface-enhanced Raman mapping, which reveal promising potential for surface- and nanoscale-based applications.
